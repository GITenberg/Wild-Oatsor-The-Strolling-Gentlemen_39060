<h3>REMARKS.</h3>

<p>With a double respect for talents, and for misfortune,
these remarks are begun.</p>

<p>The present comedy is written by O'Keeffe, who saw
not the traces of his pen as he marked the paper;
whose days pass away, uncheered by the sun or any
visible object; but whose mind supports with resignation
his bitter calamity, and is enlightened by
imagination, whilst his eyes are shut in utter darkness.</p>

<p>Were each close imitator of an author's style punishable
by law, like the perpetrator of other wrongs,
Mr. O'Keeffe might have been an independent, though
not a happy man; for that source of a new kind of mirth,
termed by some exquisite nonsense, of which he was
the first discoverer, made the town so merry, that,
like good wine, he might have sold it at any price;
but this rich juice of hilarity, polluted by the false
spirit of imitation, at length gave a stupor to those, whom
the beverage had before revived; and the pure and the
adulterated became distasteful together.</p>

<p>This comedy is the only attempt of the author to
produce a drama above opera and farce. His productions,
in the latter species of writing, are perfect
compositions: nothing of the kind can be superior to
his "Agreeable Surprise," and his "Son-in-Law."
He has a number of other farces of little less attraction;
such as "Peeping Tom."&mdash;Another class after
that, and each possessing infinite fancy, whim, and
novelty. Still success did not follow all his productions:
a few years past he wrote very frequently, and
sometimes too hastily.</p>

<p>On the first night of representing any of those
whimsical dramas, amidst loud peals of laughter at
the comic dialogue or incidents, there was generally a
most affecting spectacle behind the curtain. O'Keeffe,
stone-blind, (not an affliction of birth, but of late
years) led by his little son, as a guide, down to the
stage-door&mdash;to the lock of which he would anxiously
place his ear to catch the quickest information how
his work was received&mdash;and when, unhappily hisses
from the audience would sound louder than applause&mdash;in
strong agitation he would press his hands to each
side of his head, as if he had yet one sense too much.
Thus he would remain, without sight or hearing, till
some unexpected sally of humour in his drama once
more put the house in good temper, and they would
begin to laugh and applaud;&mdash;on which, his son,
rapid as lightning, would pull him by the elbow, and
cry out, "Now, father, listen again."</p>

<p>"Wild Oats," would not disgrace an author of
much higher pretensions in dramatic writing than
Mr. O'Keeffe. There is great pleasantry throughout
the play, many natural touches of simplicity, and
some well-written dialogues and sentiments. The plot
is interesting, the characters new, or at least in new
situations, and the whole forms an evening's entertainment
for an auditor of taste&mdash;such a one having at the
same time in his memory, certain popular sentences
from certain well-known comedies and tragedies: for
without intimate acquaintance with all the quotations
made use of by the hero of the piece, it must
totally lose its effect, and this hero appear like a
madman.</p>

<p>Perhaps, no comedy, on a first night, was ever
more fortunate in a list of excellent comic actors
to represent the characters.</p>

<p>Lewis, in Rover, fervid as usual, seemed so enamoured
of his stage exploits, that every spectator forgave
him his folly, for the bewitching ardour with
which he pursued it.</p>

<p>In Ephraim, the quaker, the spirit moved Munden&mdash;as
it always does&mdash;to act just as he should do.</p>

<p>Quick was on the London stage when this play
was first performed, and though Sir George Thunder
was by no means a part best suited to his abilities&mdash;yet
Quick gave comic importance to all he undertook.</p>

<p>Mr. Thomas Blanchard, since dead, played the little
part of Sim with wond'rous skill.</p>

<p>Mrs. Pope (once Miss Young) was excellent in Lady
Amaranth.</p>

<p>And the silly Jane can never have so good a representative
as Mrs. Wells.</p>

<h3>ACT THE FIRST.</h3>

<h5>SCENE I.</h5>
<div class="center">
<p class="noindent"><i>A Parlour in</i> <span class="smallcaps">Lady Amaranth's</span> <i>House</i>.<br />
<br />
<i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">John Dory</span>.</p>
</div>

<p><i>John.</i> Fine cruizing this! without flip or biscuit!
don't know who's the Governor of this here fort; but
if he can victual us a few&mdash;how hollow my bread
room sounds! [<i>Striking his sides.</i>] I'm as empty as a
stoved keg, and as tired as an old Dutchman&mdash;my
obstinate master, Sir George, to tow my old hulk&mdash;aboard
the house, ha, hoy!</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> [<i>Without.</i>] John! John Dory!</p>

<p><i>John.</i> [<i>Sits.</i>] I'm at anchor.</p>

<div class="center">
 <p class="noindent"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Sir George Thunder</span>.
 </p>
</div>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> I don't know who's house we've got into
here, John; but I think, when he knows me, we may
hope for some refreshment&mdash;Eh! [<i>Looking at</i> <span class="smallcaps">John</span>.]
was not I your captain?</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Yes; and I was your boatswain. And what
of all that?</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> Then how dare you sit in my presence,
you bluff head?</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Why, for the matter of that, I don't mind;
but had I been your captain, and you my boatswain,
the man, that stood by me at sea, should be welcome
to sit before me at land.</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> That's true, my dear John; offer to stand
up, and, damme, if I don't knock you down&mdash;zounds!
I am as dry as a powder match&mdash;to sail at the rate
of ten knots an hour, over fallow and stubble, from
my own house, but half a league on this side of Gosport,
and not catch these deserters!</p>

<p><i>John.</i> In this here chase you wanted the ballast of
wisdom.</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> How, sirrah! hasn't my dear old friend,
Dick Broadside, got the command of the ship I so
often fought myself&mdash;to man it for him with expedition,
didn't I (out of my own pocket) offer two guineas
over the king's bounty to every seaman that would
enter on board her? Hav'n't these three scoundrels
fingered the shot, then ran, and didn't I do right to
run after them? Damn the money! I no more mind
that than a piece of clinker; but 'twas the pride of my
heart to see my beloved ship (the Eagle) well mann'd,
when my old friend is the commander.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> But since you've laid yourself up in ordinary,
retired to live in quiet, on your estate, and had
done with all sea affairs&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> John, John, a man should forget his own
convenience for his country's good.&mdash;Though Broadside's
letter said these fellows were lurking about
this part of Hampshire, yet still it's all hide and
seek.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Your ill luck.</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> Mine, you swab?</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Ay, you've money and gold; but grace and
good fortune have shook hands with you these nineteen
years, for that rogue's trick you play'd poor Miss
Amelia, by deceiving her with a sham marriage, when
you passed yourself for Captain Seymour, and then
putting off to sea, leaving her to break her poor heart,
and since marrying another lady.</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> Wasn't I forc'd to it by my father?</p>

<p><i>John.</i>&mdash;Ay; because she had a great fortin, her
death too was a judgment upon you.</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> Why, you impudent dog-fish!&mdash;upbraid me
for running into false bay, when you were my pilot?
Wasn't it you, even brought me the false clergyman that
performed the sham marriage with Amelia?</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Yes, you think so; but I took care to bring
you a real clergyman.</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> But is this a time or place for your lectures?
At home, abroad, sea, or land, you will still
badger me! mention my Wild Oats again and&mdash;you
scoundrel, since the night my bedcurtains took fire,
when you were my boatswain aboard the Eagle,
you've got me quite into leading strings&mdash;you snatched
me upon deck, and tossed me into the sea,&mdash;to save
me from being burnt, I was almost drowned.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> You would but for me&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> Yes, you dragged me out by the ear, like a
waterdog&mdash;last week, 'cause you found the tenth bottle
uncorked, you rushed in among my friends, and
ran away with me; and, next morning Captain
O'Shanaghan sends me a challenge for quitting the
company, when he was in the chair! so, to save me
from a headach, you'd like to've got my brains blown
out.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Oh, very well; be burnt in your bed, and
tumble in the water, by jumping into boats, like a
tight fellow as you are, and poison yourself with sloe
juice; see if John cares a piece of mouldy biscuit
about it. But I wish you hadn't made me your valet
de shamber. No sooner was I got on shore, after
five years dashing among rocks, shoals, and breakers,
than you sets me on a high-trotting cart horse, which
knockt me up and down like an old bomb-boat in the
Bay of Biscay, and here's nothing to drink after all!
Because at home you keep open house, you think every
body else does the same.</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> Why, by sailing into this strange port, we
may be more free than welcome.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Holla! I'll never cease piping, 'till it calls up
a drop to wet my whistle. <span class="ex">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> Yes, (as John Dory remarks) I fear my
trip through life will be attended with heavy squalls
and foul weather. When my conduct to poor Amelia
comes athwart my mind, it's a hurricane for that day,
and turn in at night, the ballad of "Margaret and
William," rings in my ear. [<i>Sings.</i>] "In glided Margaret's
grimly ghost." Oh, zounds! the dismals are
coming upon me, and can't get a cheering glass to&mdash;holloa!</p>

<div class="center">
 <p class="noindent"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Ephraim Smooth</span>.

<p><i>Eph.</i> Friend, what would'st thou have?</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> Grog.</p>

<p><i>Eph.</i> Neither man nor woman of that name abideth
here.</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> Ha, ha, ha! man and woman! then if
you'll bring me Mr. Brandy and Mrs. Water, we'll
couple them, and the first child probably will be Master
Grog.</p>

<p><i>Eph.</i> Thou dost speak in parables, which I understand
not.</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> Sheer off with your sanctified poop, and
send the gentleman of the house.</p>

<p><i>Eph.</i> The owner of this mansion is a maiden, and
she approacheth.</p>

<div class="center">
 <p class="noindent"><i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Lady Amaranth</span>.
 </p>
</div>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> Do I behold?&mdash;It is! how dost thou
uncle?</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> Is it possible you can be my niece, Lady
Maria Amaranth Thunder?</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> I am the daughter of thy deceased brother
Loftus, called Earl Thunder, but no lady, my
name is Mary.</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> But, zounds! how is all this? Eh! unexpectedly
find you in a strange house, of which old
Sly here tells me you're the mistress; turned quaker,
and disclaim your title!</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> Thou know'st the relation to whose care
my father left me?</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> Well! I know our cousin, old Dovehouse,
was a quaker! but I didn't suspect he would have
made you one.</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> Being now gathered to his fathers, he
did bequeath unto me his worldly goods; amongst
them this mansion, and the lands around it.</p>

<p><i>Eph.</i> So thou becom'st and continue one of the
faithful. I am executor of his will, and by it, I cannot
give thee, Mary, possession of these goods, but on
those conditions.</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> Tell me of your thee's and thou's, quaker's
wills and mansions! I say, girl, though on the death
of your father, my eldest brother, Loftus, Earl Thunder,
from your being a female, his title devolved to
his next brother, Robert; though, as a woman, you
can't be an earl, nor as a woman, you can't make
laws for your sex and our sex, yet, as the daughter
of a peer, you are, and, by Heaven, shall be called
Lady Maria Amaranth Thunder.</p>

<p><i>Eph.</i> Thou makest too much noise, friend.</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> Call me friend, and I'll bump your block
against the capstern.</p>

<p><i>Eph.</i> Yea, this is a man of danger, and I will leave
Mary to abide it. <span class="ex">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

of the air, call'd woodcocks, and ribs of the oxen
likewise?</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> All. My uncle sojourneth with me peradventure,
and my meal shall be a feast, friend Zachariah.</p>

<p><i>Zach.</i> My tongue shall say so, friend Mary.</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> [<i>Strikes him.</i>] Sir George Thunder bids
thee remember to call your mistress, Lady Amaranth.</p>

<p><i>Zach.</i> Verily, George.</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> George! sirrah, though a younger brother,
the honour of knighthood was my reward for
placing the glorious British flag over that of a daring
enemy&mdash;therefore address me with respect.</p>

<p><i>Zach.</i> Yea, I do, good George. <span class="ex">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> George and Mary! here's levelling, here's
abolition of title with a vengeance!</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> Kinsman, be patient; thou, and thy son,
my cousin Henry, whom I have not beheld, I think,
these twelve years, shall be welcome to my dwelling.
Where now abideth the youth?</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> At the Naval Academy, at Portsmouth.</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> May I not see the young man?</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> What, to make a quaker of him?&mdash;No,
no. But, hold, as she's now a wealthy heiress, her
marrying my son Harry, will keep up and preserve
her title in our own family too. [<i>Aside.</i>] Would'st
thou really be glad to see him? thou shalt, Mary.

for he happens to be out of the dock already.</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> What wind now?</p>

<p><i>John.</i> You know, on our quitting harbour&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> Damn your sea jaw, you marvellous dolphin,
give the contents of your logbook in plain English.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> The young squire has cut and run.</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> What?</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Got leave to come to you: and master didn't
find out before yesterday, that, instead of making for
home, he had sheer'd off towards London; directly
sent notice to you, and Sam has traced us all the way
here to bring you the news.</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> What, a boy of mine quit his guns? I'll
grapple him.&mdash;Come, John.</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> Order the carriage for mine uncle.</p>

<p><i>Eph.</i> I will; for this damsel is passing fair, and
hath found grace in mine eyes. Mary, as thou
art yet a stranger in this land, and just taken possession
of this estate, the laws of society command thee
to be on terms of amity with thy wealthy neighbours.</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> Yea; but while I entertain the rich, the
hearts of the poor shall also rejoice; I myself will
now go forth into the adjacent hamlet, and invite all
that cometh, to hearty cheer.</p>

<p><i>Eph.</i> Yea, I will distribute among the poor good
books.</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> And meat and drink too, friend Ephraim.
In the fulness of plenty, they shall join in
thanksgiving for those gifts of which I am so unworthy. <span class="ex">[<i>Exeunt.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Midge.</i> I say, Dick Buskin! harkye, my lad!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> What keeps Rover?</p>

<p><i>Midge.</i> I'm sure I don't know. As you desired,
I paid for our breakfast. But the devil's in that
fellow; every inn we stop at, he will always hang
behind, chattering to the bar-maid, or chamber-maid.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Or any, or no maid. But he's a worthy
lad; and I love him better, I think, than my own
brother, had I one.</p>

<p><i>Midge.</i> Oh! but, Dick, mind, my boy.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Stop, Midge. Though 'twas my orders,
when I set out on this scamper with the players, (the
better to conceal my quality,) for you, before people,
to treat me as your companion; yet, at the same
time, you should have had discretion enough to remember,
when we're alone, that I am still your
master, and son to Sir George Thunder.</p>

<p><i>Midge.</i> Sir, I ask your pardon; but by making
yourself my equal, I've got so used to familiarity, that
I find it curst hard to shake it off.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Well, sir, pray mind, that familiarity is all
over now. My frolic's out, I now throw off the
player, and shall directly return. My father must
by this time, have heard of my departure from the
academy at Portsmouth; and, though I was deluded
away by my rage for a little acting, yet 'twas wrong
of me to give the gay old fellow any cause of uneasiness.</p>

<p><i>Midge.</i> And, sir, shall you and I never act another
scene together? Shall I never again play Colonel
Standard for my own benefit? Never again have the
pleasure of caning your honour in the character of Tom
Errand.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> In future, act the part of a smart hat and
coat brusher; or I shall have the honour of kicking
you in the character of an idle puppy. You were a
good servant; but I find, by letting you crack your
jokes, and sit in my company, you're grown quite a
rascal.</p>

<p><i>Midge.</i> Yes, sir, I was a modest, well behaved
lad; but evil communication corrupts good manners.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Begone, sirrah, 'till I call for you.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smallcaps">Midge</span>, <i>grumbling</i>.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Well, if my father but forgives me.&mdash;This
three month's excursion has shewn me some life, and
a devilish deal of fun. For one circumstance, I shall
ever remember it with delight. Its bringing me acquainted
with Jack Rover. How long he stays! Jack!
In this forlorn stroller, I have discovered qualities that
honour human nature, and accomplishments that
might grace a prince. I don't know a pleasanter fellow,
except when he gets to his abominable habit of
quotation. I hope he will not find the purse I've hid
in his coat pocket, before we part. I dread the moment,
but it's come.</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> [<i>Without.</i>] "The brisk li-li-lightening I."</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Ay, here's the rattle. Hurried on by the
impetuous flow of his own volatile spirits, his life is a
rapid stream of extravagant whim; and while the serious
voice of humanity prompts his heart to the best
of actions, his features shine in laugh and levity. Studying
Bays, eh, Jack?</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> "I am the bold Thunder."</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> [<i>Aside.</i>] I am, if he knew but all.&mdash;Keep
one standing in the road.</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> Beg your pardon, my dear Dick; but all
the fault of&mdash;Plague on't, that a man can't sleep and
breakfast at an inn, then return up to his bedchamber
for his gloves that he'd forgot, but there he must find
chambermaids, thumping feathers and knocking pillows
about, and keep one when one has affairs and business.
'Pon <ins title="original has my my">my</ins> soul, these girls' conduct to us
is intolerable. The very thought brings the blood
into my face, and whenever they attempt to serve,
provoke me so, damme but I will, I will&mdash;An't I right,
Dick?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> No; "all in the wrong."</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> No matter, Dick; that's the universal play
"all round the wrekin:" but you are so conceited, because,
by this company you're going to join at Winchester,
you are engaged for high tragedy.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> And you for Rangers, Plumes, and Foppingtons.</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> Our first play is Lear. I was devilish imperfect
in Edgar, t'other night at Lymington. I must
look it over. [<i>Takes out a book.</i>] "Away, the foul
fiend follows me!" Hollo! stop a moment, we shall
have the whole county after us. <span class="ex">[<i>Going.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> What now?</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> That rosy faced chambermaid put me in
such a passion, that, by Heaven, I walked out of the
house, and forgot to pay our bill. <span class="ex">[<i>Going.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Never mind, Rover, it's paid.</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> Paid! why, neither you nor Midge had money
enough. No, really!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Ha, ha, ha! I tell you 'tis.</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> You paid? Oh, very well. Every honest
fellow should be a stock purse. Come then, let's push
on now. Ten miles to Winchester; we shall be there
by eleven.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Our trunks are booked at the inn for the
Winchester coach.</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> "Ay, to foreign climates my old trunk I
bear." But I prefer walking to the car of Thespis.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Which is the way?</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> Here.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Then, I go there. [<i>Pointing opposite.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> Eh!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> My dear boy, on this spot, and at this moment,
we must part.</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> Part!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Rover, you wish me well.</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> Well, and suppose so. Part, eh! What mystery
and grand? What are you at? Do you forget,&mdash;you,
Midge, and I, are engaged to Truncheon, the manager,
and that the bills are already up with our
names to-night to play at Winchester?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Jack, you and I have often met on a stage
in assumed characters; if it's your wish we should
ever meet again in our real ones, of sincere friends,
without asking whither I go, or my motives for leaving
you, when I walk up this road, do you turn down
that.</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> Joke!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> I'm serious. Good b'ye!</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> If you repent your engagement with Truncheon,
I'll break off too, and go with you wherever&mdash;[<i>Takes him under the arm.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Attempt to follow me, and even our acquaintance
ends.</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> Eh!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Don't think of my reasons, only that it
must be.</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> Have I done any thing to Dick Buskin?
leave me! [<i>Turns and puts his handkerchief to his eyes.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> I am as much concerned as you to&mdash;Good

<p><i>F. Gam.</i> Well, Master Ephraim, I may depend on
thee, as you quakers never break your words.</p>

<p><i>Eph.</i> I have spoken to Mary, and she, at my request,
consenteth to take thy daughter, Jane, as her
handmaid.</p>

<p><i>F. Gam.</i> Very good of you.</p>

<p><i>Eph.</i> Goodness I do like, and also&mdash;comely Jane.
[<i>Aside.</i>] The maiden I will prefer, for the sake of&mdash;myself.
[<i>Aside.</i>]</p>

<p><i>F. Gam.</i> I intended to make a present to the person
that does me such a piece of service; but I shan't
affront you with it.</p>

<p><i>Eph.</i> I am meek and humble, and must take
affronts.</p>

<p><i>F. Gam.</i> Then here's a guinea, master Ephraim.</p>

<p><i>Eph.</i> I expected not this; but there is no harm in
a guinea. <span class="ex">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>F. Gam.</i> So I shall get my children off my hands.
My son, Sim, is robbing me day and night,&mdash;giving
away my corn and what not among the poor.&mdash;My
daughter Jane&mdash;when girls have nought to do, this
love-mischief creeps into their minds, and then hey!

</div>

<p><i>Jane.</i> Did you call me?</p>

<p><i>F. Gam.</i> I often told you both, (but it's now settled)
you must go out into the world, and work for your
bread.</p>

<p><i>Sim.</i> Well, feyther, whatever you think right, must
be so, and I'm content.</p>

<p><i>Jane.</i> And I'm sure, feyther, I'm willing to do as
you'd have me.</p>

<p><i>F. Gam.</i> There's ingratitude for you! When my
wife died, I brought you both up from the shell, and
now you want to fly off and forsake me.</p>

<p><i>Sim.</i> Why no; I'm willing to live with you all my
days.</p>

<p><i>Jane.</i> And I'm sure, feyther, if it's your desire I'll
never part from you.</p>

<p><i>F. Gam.</i> What, you want to hang upon me like a
couple of leeches, ay, to strip my branches, and leave
me a wither'd hawthorn! See who's yon.</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smallcaps">Sim.</span></p>

<p class="noindent">Jane, Ephraim Smooth has hired you for Lady Amaranth.</p>

<p><i>Jane.</i> O lack! then I shall live in the great house.</p>

<p><i>F. Gam.</i> She has sent us all presents of good books,
[<i>Gives her one.</i>] to read a chapter in. That, when
one's in a passion, gives a mon patience.</p>

<p><i>Jane.</i> Thank her good ladyship.</p>

<p><i>F. Gam.</i> My being incumbred with you both is the
cause why old Banks won't give me his sister.</p>

<p><i>Jane.</i> That's a pity. If we must have a step-mother,
Madam Amelia would make us a very good
one. But I wonder how she can refuse you, feyther,
for I'm sure she must think you a very portly man in
your scarlet vest and new scratch. You can't think
how parsonable you'd look, if you'd only shave twice
a week, and put sixpence in the poor-box. [<i>Retires
reading.</i>]</p>

<p><i>F. Gam.</i> However, if Banks still refuses, I have him
in my power. I'll turn them both out of their cottage
yonder, and the bailiff shall provide them with a
lodging.</p>

<p><i>Banks.</i> That she best knows.</p>

<p><i>F. Gam.</i> Ay, but she says she won't.</p>

<p><i>Banks.</i> Then I dare say she won't, for though a
woman, I never knew her to speak what she didn't
think.</p>

<p><i>F. Gam.</i> Then she won't have me? A fine thing
this, that you and she, who are little better than
paupers, dare be so damn'd saucy!</p>

<p><i>Banks.</i> Why, farmer, I confess we're poor: but
while that's the worst our enemies can say of us, we're
content.</p>

<p><i>F. Gam.</i> Od, dom it! I wish I had now a good,
fair occasion to quarrel with him; I'd make him content

village. He wants a barn to play in, if you'll hire
him yourn.</p>

<p><i>F. Gam.</i> Surely, boy. I'll never refuse money.
But, lest he should engage the great room in the inn,
run thou and tell him&mdash;Stop, I'll go myself&mdash;A short
cut through that garden.&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Banks.</i> Why you, or any neighbour is welcome to
walk in it, or to partake of what it produces, but
making it a common thoroughfare is&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Banks.</i> What?</p>

<p><i>F. Gam.</i> Does the lad hear?</p>

<p><i>Sim.</i> Why yes, yes.</p>

<p><i>F. Gam.</i> Does the fool understand.</p>

<p><i>Sim.</i> Dang it, I'm as yet but young; but if understanding
teaches me how to wrong my neighbour, I
hope I may never live to years of discretion.</p>

<p><i>F. Gam.</i> What, you cur, do you disobey your feyther?
Burst open the garden gate, as I command you.</p>

<p><i>Sim.</i> Feyther, he, that made both you and the garden,
commands me not to injure the unfortunate.</p>

<p><i>F. Gam.</i> Here's an ungracious rogue! Then I must
do it myself. [<i>Advances.</i>]</p>

<p><i>Banks.</i> [<i>Stands before it.</i>] Hold, neighbour. Small
as this spot is, it's now my only possession: and the
man shall first take my life, who sets a foot in it against
my will.</p>

</div>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> Though thou hast settled that distressed
gentleman's debt, let his sister come unto me; and
remit a quarter's rent unto all my tenants.</p>

<p><i>Eph.</i> As thou bid'st I have discharged from the
pound the widow's cattle; but shall I let the lawsuit
drop against the farmer's son who did shoot the pheasant?</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> Yea; but instantly turn from my service
the gamekeeper's man that did kill the fawn,
while it was eating from his hand. We should hate
guile, though we may love venison.</p>

<p><i>Eph.</i> I love a young doe.&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>] Since the death
of friend Dovehouse, who, (though one of the faithful)
was an active magistrate, this part of the country is
infested with covetous men, called robbers, and I have,
in thy name, said unto the people, whoever apprehendeth
one of these, I will reward him, yea with
thirty pieces of gold. [<i>A loud knocking without.</i>] That
beating of one brass against another at thy door, proclaimeth
the approach of vanity, whose pride of heart
swelleth at an empty sound. <span class="ex">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> But my heart is possessed with the idea
of that wandering youth, whose benevolence induced
him to part with, perhaps, his all, to free the unhappy
debtor. His person is amiable, his address (according
to worldly modes) formed to please, to delight.
But he's poor; is that a crime? Perhaps meanly born:
but one good action is an illustrious pedigree. I feel
I love him, and in that word are birth, fame, and
riches.</p>

<p><i>Jane.</i> I found him, ma'am, and&mdash;I found him, and
he talked of&mdash;what he said.</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> What did he say?</p>

<p><i>Jane.</i> He saw me, ma'am&mdash;and call'd me Blowsabella,

didn't say he would&mdash;Now, think of that;&mdash;but if he

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> Thy father designs thee for his dangerous

when the blast of war blows in his ears, he's a tyger
in his fierce resentment."&mdash;But for me, "I think it a

a good tall fellow has destroyed, with wounds and

<p><i>Rover.</i> It is. My good friend, if I was really the
unfortunate poor strolling dog you thought me, I
should tread your four boards, and crow the cock of
your barn-door fowl; but as fate has ordained that
I'm a gentleman, and son to Sir,&mdash;Sir,&mdash;what the devil's
my father's name? [<i>Aside.</i>] you must be content to

Trap, have trumpeted your fame ten miles round the
country:&mdash;the bills are posted, the stage built, the
candles booked, fiddles engaged; all on the tip-top of
expectation. We should have to-morrow night an

myself.</p>

brought up, thou shalt not sully thy honour by a
breach of thy word. Play, if it can bring good to
these people.</p>

all the gentry round unto my house warming, and
these pleasantries may afford them a cheerful and innocent
entertainment.</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> True, my lady; your guests ar'n't quakers
though you are, and when we ask people to our
house, we study to please them, not ourselves. But
if we do furbish a play or two, the muses sha'n't honour
that churlish fellow's barn. No; the god, that
illumines the soul of genius, should never visit the
iron door of inhumanity. No Gammon's barn for
me!&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> Barn! no; that gallery shall be thy
theatre; and, in spite of the grave doctrines of
Ephraim Smooth, my friends and I will behold and
rejoice in thy pranks, my pleasant cousin.</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> Damn your liquor, you self-interested
porpoise! Chatter your own private concerns, when
the public good, or fear of general calamity, should
be the only compass! These fellows, that I'm in pursuit
of, have run from their ships; if our navy's unmann'd,

Buskin here.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Then Dick Buskin might find some other
amusement than shooting off his guns here.</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> Did you bring my son to Lady Amaranth's
in her chariot?</p>

<p><i>John.</i> And to be sure I did.</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> There, what do you say to that?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> I say it's false.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> False! Shiver my hulk, Mr. Buskin, if you
wore a lion's skin, I'd curry you for this.</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> No, no, John's honest; I see through it
now. The puppy has seen her, perhaps he has the
impudence not to like her, and so blows up this confusion
and perplexity only to break off a marriage
that I've set my heart on.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> What does he mean? Sir, I'll assure
you&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> Damn your assurance, you disobedient,
ungrateful&mdash;I'll not part with you till I confront you
with Lady Amaranth herself, face to face, and if I
prove you've been deceiving me, I'll launch you into
the wide ocean of life without rudder, compass, grog,

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> The fanciful flights of my pleasant
cousin enchant my senses. This book he gave me to
read containeth good moral. The man Shakspeare,
that did write it, they call immortal; he must indeed
have been filled with a divine spirit. I understand,
from my cousin, the origin of plays were religious
mysteries; that, freed from the superstition of early,
and the grossness of latter, ages, the stage is now the
vehicle of delight and morality. If so, to hear a good
play, is taking the wholesome draught of precept
from a golden cup, embossed with gems; yet, my
giving countenance to have one in my house, and
even to act in it myself, prove the ascendancy, that
my dear Harry hath over my heart&mdash;Ephraim Smooth
is much scandalized at these doings.</p>

<p><i>Eph.</i> This mansion is now the tabernacle of Baal.</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> Then abide not in it.</p>

<p><i>Eph.</i> 'Tis full of the wicked ones.</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> Stay not amongst the wicked ones.</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Loud laughing without.</i></p>

<p><i>Eph.</i> I must shut mine ears.</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> And thy mouth also, good Ephraim.
I have bidden my cousin Henry to my house, and I
will not set bounds to his mirth to gratify thy spleen,
and show mine own inhospitality.</p>

<p><i>Eph.</i> Why dost thou suffer him to put into the
hands of thy servants books of tragedies, and books
of comedies, prelude, interlude, yea, all lewd. My
spirit doth wax wrath. I say unto thee a playhouse
is the school for the old dragon, and a playbook the
primer of Belzebub.</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> This is one; mark! [<i>Reads.</i>] "Not the
king's crown, nor the deputed sword, the marshal's
truncheon, nor the judge's robe, become them with
one half so good a grace as mercy doth. Oh, think
on that, and mercy then will breathe within your lips
like man new made!"&mdash;Doth Belzebub speak such
words?</p>

<p><i>Eph.</i> Thy kinsman has made all the servants
actors.</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> To act well is good service.</p>

play's to be "As you like it."</p>

<p><i>Eph.</i> I like it not.</p>

<p><i>Jane.</i> He's given me my character. I'm to be
Miss Audrey, and brother Sim's to be William of
the forest, as it were. But how am I to get my part
by heart?</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> By often reading it.</p>

<p><i>Jane.</i> Well, I don't know but that's as good as any
other. But I must study my part. "The gods give
us joy." <span class="ex">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

an angry fiend broke in among the laughing gods."&mdash;Come,

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> But, Harry, do your people of fashion
act these follies themselves.</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> Ay, and scramble for the top parts as eager
as for star, ribband, place, or pension. Lamp, decorate
the seats out smart and theatrical, and drill the
servants that I've given the small parts to&mdash;</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Exit</i> <span class="smallcaps">Lamp</span>.</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> I wished for some entertainment, (in
which gay people now take delight,) to please those
I have invited; but we'll convert these follies into a
charitable purpose. Tickets for this day shall be
delivered unto my friends gratis; but money to their
amount, I will, from my own purse (after rewarding
our assistants) distribute amongst the indigent of the
village. Thus, whilst we please ourselves, and perhaps
amuse our friends, we shall make the poor
happy.</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> An angel! If Sir George doesn't soon arrive,
to blow me, I may, I think, marry her angelic
ladyship; but will that be honest? She's nobly born,
though I suspect I had ancestors too, if I knew who
they were. I certainly entered this house the poorest
wight in England, and what must she imagine when
I am discovered? That I am a scoundrel; and, consequently,
though I should possess her hand and fortune,

Ha! ha! ha! Talk of the devil, and&mdash;I was just
thinking of you&mdash;'Pon my soul, Dick, I'm so happy
to see you!</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Shakes hands cordially.</i></p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> But, Jack, eh, perhaps you found me out?</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> Found you! I'm sure I wonder how the
deuce you found me out. Ah, the news of my intended
play has brought you.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> He does'nt know as yet who I am; so I'll
carry it on. [<i>Aside.</i>] Then you too have broke your
engagement with Truncheon, at Winchester; figuring
it away in your stage clothes too. Really, tell
us what you are at here, Jack?</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> Will you be quiet with your Jacking? I'm
now 'Squire Harry.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> What?</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> I've been pressed into this service by an
old man of war, who found me at the inn, and, insisting
I am son to a Sir George Thunder, here, in
that character, I flatter myself I have won the heart
of the charming lady of this house.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Now the mystery's out. Then it's my friend
Jack has been brought here for me! [<i>Aside.</i>] Do you
know the young gentleman they take you for?</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> No: but I flatter myself he is honoured in
his representative.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Upon my soul, Jack, you're a very high
fellow.</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> I am, now I can put some pounds in your
pockets; you shall be employed&mdash;we're getting up
"<i>As you like it.</i>" Let's see, in the cast have I a part
for you?&mdash;I'll take Touchstone from Lamp, you shall
have it, my boy; I'd resign Orlando to you with any
other Rosalind; but the lady of the mansion plays it
herself, you rogue.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> The very lady my father intended for me.
[<i>Aside.</i>] Do you love her, Jack?</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> To distraction; but I'll not have her.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> No! Why?</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> She thinks me a gentleman, and I'll not
convince her I am a rascal. I'll go on with our play,
as the produce is appropriated to a good purpose,
and then lay down my 'squireship, bid adieu to my
heavenly Rosalind, and exit for ever from her house,
poor Jack Rover.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> The generous fellow I ever thought him!
and he sha'n't lose by it. If I could make him believe&mdash;[<i>Aside.</i>]
Well, this is the most whimsical affair!
You've anticipated, superseded me, ha! ha!

though) to pass myself for this young Henry.</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> [<i>Without.</i>] Harry, where are you?</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> Eh! who's that?</p>

be cursedly vexed; but no other way. <span class="ex">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> Somebody called Harry&mdash;Zounds! "if the

<p><i>Harry.</i> Be quiet&mdash;that's my confederate.</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> Eh!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> He's to personate the father, Sir George.
He started the scheme, having heard that a union was
intended, and Sir George not immediately expected&mdash;our
plan is, if I can, before his arrival, flourish
myself into the lady's good graces, and whip her up,
as she's an heiress.</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> But who is this comrade?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> One of our company, a devilish good actor
in the old man.</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> So you're turned fortune-hunter! Oh, oh!
then 'twas on this plan that you parted with me on
the road, standing like a finger post, "you walk up
that way, and I must walk down this." [<i>Mimicks.</i>]
Why, Dick, I did'nt know you were half so capital
a rogue.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> I did'nt know my forte lay that way, till
persuaded by this experienced stager.</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> He must be an impudent old scoundrel;
who is he? Do I not know him?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Why, no&mdash;I hope not. <span class="ex">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> I'll step down stairs, and have the honour
of&mdash;I'll kick him.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Stop! No, I wou'dn't have him hurt neither.</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> What's his name?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> His name is&mdash;is&mdash;Abrawang.</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> Abrawang! Abrawang! I never heard of
him; but, Dick, why would you let him persuade you
to such a scandalous affair?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Why faith, I would have been off it; but
when once he takes a project into his head, the devil
himself can't drive him out of it.</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> Yes; but the constable may drive him into
Winchester gaol.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Eh! your opinion of our intended exploit
has made me ashamed of myself&mdash;Ha! ha! ha!
Harkey, Jack, to frighten and punish my adviser, do
you still keep on your character of young 'Squire
Thunder&mdash;you can easily do that, as he, no more
than myself, has ever seen the young gentleman.</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> But by Heavens I'll&mdash;"Quoit him down,
Bardolph."</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Yes; but, Jack, if you can marry her, her
fortune is a snug thing: besides, if you love each
other&mdash;I tell you&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> Hang, her fortune! "My love, more noble
than the world, prizes not quantity of dirty lands."
Oh, Dick, she's the most lovely&mdash;she is female beauty
in its genuine decoration! <span class="ex">[<i>Exit.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Ha! ha! ha! this is the drollest&mdash;Rover
little suspects that I am the identical Squire Thunder
that he personates&mdash;I'll lend him my character
a little longer. Yes, this offers a most excellent opportunity
of making my poor friend's fortune, without
injuring any body; if possible, he shall have her. I
can't regret the loss of charms I never knew; and,
as for an estate, my father's is competent to all my
wishes. Lady Amaranth, by marrying Jack Rover,
will gain a man of honour, which she might miss in
an earl&mdash;it may tease my father a little at first, but
he's a good old fellow in the main; and, I think, when
he comes to know my motive&mdash;Eh! this must be she&mdash;an
elegant woman, faith! Now for a spanking lie,

she thinks him.</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> Who art thou, friend?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Madam, I've scarce time to warn you
against the danger you are in, of being imposed upon
by your uncle, Sir George.</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> How?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> He has heard of your ladyship's partiality
for his son; but is so incensed at the irregularity of
his conduct, he intends, if possible, to disinherit him;
and, to prevent your honouring him with your hand,
had engaged, and brought me hither, to pass me on
you for him, designing to treat the poor young gentleman
himself as an impostor, in hopes you'll banish
him your heart and house.</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> Is Sir George such a parent? I thank
thee for thy caution.&mdash;What is thy name?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Richard Buskin, ma'am; the stage is my
profession. In the young 'squire's late excursion, we
contracted an intimacy, and I saw so many good qualities
in him, that I could not think of being the instrument
of his ruin, nor deprive your ladyship of
so good a husband, as I am certain he'll make
you.</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> Then Sir George intends to disown
him?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Yes, ma'am; I've this moment told the
young gentleman of it; and he's determined, for a
jest, to return the compliment, by seeming to treat Sir
George himself as an impostor.</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> Ha, ha, ha! 'twill be a just retaliation,
and, indeed, what my uncle deserveth for his cruel intentions
both to his son and me.</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> [<i>Without.</i>] What, has he run away again?</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> That's mine uncle.</p>

out that I am not his son, will rouse him into the heat
of battle, ha, ha, ha! [<i>Aside.</i>] Here he is, madam, now

and put my neighbour in possession.</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> My steward oppress the poor! I did not

<p><i>Banks.</i> The pangs of adversity I could bear; but
the innocent partner of my misfortunes, my unhappy
sister&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> I did desire Ephraim to send for thy sister&mdash;Did
she dwell with thee, and both now without
a home? Let her come to mine.</p>

<p><i>Banks.</i> The hand of misery hath struck us beneath
your notice.</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> Thou dost mistake&mdash;To need my assistance
is the highest claim to my attention; let me see
her. [<i>Exit</i> <span class="smallcaps">Banks</span>.] I could chide myself that these
pastimes have turned my eye from the house of woe.

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> Thou art welcome&mdash;I feel myself interested
in thy concerns.</p>

<p><i>Amelia.</i> Madam!</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> I judge, thou wert not always unhappy.&mdash;Tell
me thy condition, then I shall better know
how to serve thee. Is thy brother thy sole kindred?</p>

<p><i>Amelia.</i> I had a husband, and a son.</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> A widow! If it recall not images thou
wouldst forget, impart to me thy story&mdash;'Tis rumoured
in the village, thy brother is a clergyman&mdash;tell
me.</p>

<p><i>Amelia.</i> Madam, he was; but he has lost his early
patron, and is now poor and unbeneficed.</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> But thy husband&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Amelia.</i> By this brother's advice, now twenty years
since, I was prevailed on to listen to the addresses of
a young sea officer, (for my brother has been a chaplain
in the navy) but to our surprise and mortification,
we discovered by the honesty of a sailor, in whom he
put confidence, that the captain's design was only to
decoy me into a seeming marriage; he ordered him to
procure a counterfeit clergyman; our humble friend,
instead of us, put the deceit upon his master, by concealing
from him that my brother was in orders; he,
flattered with the hopes of procuring me an establishment,
gave in to the supposed imposture, and performed
the ceremony.</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> Duplicity, even with a good intent, is
ill.</p>

<p><i>Amelia.</i> Madam, the event has justified your censure;
for my husband, not knowing himself really
bound by any legal tie, abandoned me&mdash;I followed
him to the Indies, distracted, still seeking him&mdash;I
left my infant at one of our settlements; but, after
a fruitless pursuit, on my return, I found the friend,
to whose care I had committed my child, was compelled
to retire from the ravages of war, but where
I could not learn. Rent with agonizing pangs, now
without child or husband, I again saw England,
and my brother; who, wounded with remorse, for
being the cause of my misfortunes, secluded himself
from the joys of social life, and invited me to partake
the comforts of solitude in that humble asylum, from
whence we've both just now been driven.</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> My pity can do thee no good, yet I pity
thee; but as resignation to what must be, may restore
peace, if my means can procure thee comfort, they
are at thy pleasure. Come, let thy griefs subside, instead
of thy cottage, accept, thou and thy brother,
every convenience that my mansion can afford.</p>

we have delights going forward that may amuse
thee.</p>

<p class="noindent"><i>A Road.</i><br />
<br />
<i>Enter three</i> <span class="smallcaps">Ruffians</span>, <i>dressed as Sailors</i>.
</p>
</div>

<p><i>1st Ruff.</i> Well, now, what's to be done?</p>

<p><i>2d Ruff.</i> Why, we've been long upon our shifts, and
after all our tricks, twists, and turns, as London was
then too hot for us, our tramp to Portsmouth was a
hit.</p>

<p><i>3d Ruff.</i> Ay; but since the cash we touched, upon
pretending to be able bodied seamen, is now come to
the last shilling, as we have deserted, means of a fresh
supply to take us back to London, must be thought
on.</p>

<p><i>2d Ruff.</i> Ay, how to recruit the pocket without
hazarding the neck.</p>

<p><i>1st Ruff.</i> By an advertisement posted on the stocks
yonder, there are collectors upon this road; thirty
guineas are offered by the quaker lady, owner of the
estate round here; I wish we could snap any straggler
to bring before her. A quaker will only require
a yea for an oath&mdash;we might sack these thirty guineas.</p>

<p><i>2d Ruff.</i> Yes; but we must take care, if we fall
into the hands of this gentleman that's in pursuit of
us<span class="nowrap">&mdash;&mdash;</span>'Sdeath, isn't that his man, the old boatswain?</p>

<p><i>1st Ruff.</i> Don't run, I think we three are a match
for him.</p>

<p><i>2d Ruff.</i> Instantly put on your characters of sailors;
we may get something out of him: a pitiful story
makes such an impression on the soft heart of a true
tar, that he'll open his hard hand, and drop you his last
guinea&mdash;If we can but make him believe we were
pressed, we have him; only mind me.</p>

<p><i>1st Ruff.</i> We three hands, just come home after a
long voyage, were pressed in the river, and without
letting us see our friends, brought round to Portsmouth,
and there we entered freely, cause why? We
had no choice, then we run. We hear some gentleman
is in chace of us, so as the shot are all out, we'll
surrender.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Surrender! Oh then you've no shot left indeed&mdash;let's

yonder; I'll raise a wind to blow you into safe latitude&mdash;keep
out to sea, my master's the rock you'll
certainly split upon.</p>

<p><i>2d Ruff.</i> This is the first time we ever saw you; but
we'll steer by your chart, for I never knew one seaman
to betray another.</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Exeunt</i> <span class="smallcaps">Ruffians</span>.</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> Then they have been pressed&mdash;I can't

<p><i>John.</i> Yes, Sir George would certainly hang them.</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> I wouldn't, they shall eat beef, and drink
the king's health, run and tell them so&mdash;stop, I'll tell
them myself.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Why, now you are yourself, and a kind, good
gentleman, as you used to be.</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> Since these idle rogues are inclined to return
to their duty, they shan't want sea store&mdash;take

<p><i>Off.</i> Yes; but see if I don't suit you with an action.</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> "Right, suit the action to the word, the
word to the action;" "See if the gentlewoman be not
affrighted"&mdash;"Michael, I'll make thee an example."</p>

<p><i>Off.</i> Yes, fine example, when goods are seized here
by the law, and&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> "Thou worm and maggot of the law!"
"Hop me over every kennel, or you shall hop without
my custom."</p>

<p><i>Off.</i> I don't value your custom.</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> You are astonished, now I'll amaze you.</p>

<p><i>Off.</i> No, sir, I won't be amazed&mdash;but only see if I
don't&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> Hop!</p>

your most obedient humble servant. [<i>Bows respectfully,
and exit hastily</i>.]</p>

<p><i>Amelia.</i> I feel a strange curiosity to know who this
young gentleman is. I find my heart interested, I
can't account for&mdash;he must have known the house by
the freedom&mdash;but then his gaiety, (without familiar
rudeness) native elegance of manners, and good breeding,
seem to make him at home any where.&mdash;My
brother, I think, must know&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p><i>Banks.</i> Amelia, did you see the young gentleman
that was here? Some ruffian fellows, and a posse of the
country people have bound and dragged him from
the door, on the allegation of three men, who mean
to swear he has robbed them; and they have taken
him to Lady Amaranth's.</p>

<p><i>Amelia.</i> How! He did enter here in confusion as if
pursued; but I'll stake my life on his innocence. I'll
speak to Lady Amaranth, and in spite of calumny, he
shall have justice&mdash;he would not let me be insulted,
because he saw me an unprotected woman, without a
husband or a son, and shall he want an advocate?
Brother, come. <span class="ex">[<i>Exeunt.</i></span></p>

<i>Enter</i> <span class="smallcaps">Jane</span>, <i>with a light</i>.</p>
</div>

<p><i>Jane.</i> I believe there's not a soul in the house but
myself; my lady has sent all the folks round the
country to search after the young 'squire, she'll certainly
break her heart if any thing happens to him;
I don't wonder, for surely he's a dear, sweet gentleman:
the pity of it is, his going spoils all our fine
play, and I had just got my part quite by heart; however,
I must do the room up for Mr. Banks's sister,
that my lady has invited here.</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Adjusts her toilet.</i></p>

 </p>
</div>

<p><i>Eph.</i> The man John Dory has carried the man
George hither in his arms, and has locked him up.
Coming into the house, they did look to me like a
blue lobster with a shrimp in his claws&mdash;Oh, here is
the damsel I love, and alone.</p>

<p><i>Jane.</i> They say when folks look in the glass, at
night, they see the black gentleman.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>As she is looking in a glass</i>, <span class="smallcaps">Ephraim</span> <i>goes and<br />
peeps over her shoulders; she screams</i>.</p>

<p><i>Eph.</i> Thou art employed in vanity.</p>

<p><i>Jane.</i> Well, who wants you?</p>

<p><i>Eph.</i> It is natural for woman to love man.</p>

<p><i>Jane.</i> Yes; but not such ugly men as you are.
Why would you come in to frighten me, when you
know there's nobody here but ourselves.</p>

<p><i>Eph.</i> I am glad of that. I am the elm and thou
the honey suckle; let thy arms entwine me.</p>

<p><i>Jane.</i> Oh, what a rogue is here! but yonder comes
my lady, and I'll show him off to her in his true
colours. <span class="ex">[<i>Aside.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Eph.</i> Clasp me around.</p>

<p><i>Jane.</i> Well, I will, if you'll take off your hat, and
make me a fine low bow.</p>

<p><i>Eph.</i> I cannot bend my knee, nor take off my
beaver.</p>

<p><i>Jane.</i> Then you're very impudent&mdash;go along.</p>

<p><i>Eph.</i> But to win thy favour.</p>

<p class="right">[<i>Takes off his hat, and bows.</i></p>

<p><i>Jane.</i> Now kneel down to me.</p>

<p><i>Eph.</i> I cannot, but one lovely smile may smile me
down.</p>
<p class="right">[<i>She smiles, he kneels.</i></p>

<p><i>Jane.</i> Well, now, read me a speech out of that fine
play-book.</p>

<p><i>Eph.</i> I read a play! a-bo-mi-na-ti-on!&mdash;But, Jane,
wilt thou kiss me?</p>

<p><i>Jane.</i> I kiss a man! a-bo-mi-na-ti-on! [<i>Mimicking.</i>]
but you may take my hand&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Eph.</i> Oh! 'tis a comfort to the lip of the faithful.</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> Hold&mdash;soft!</p>

<p><i>Amelia.</i> Are you at length returned to me, my
Seymour?</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> Seymour! her mind is disturbed, this is
mine uncle, Sir George Thunder.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> No, no, my lady, she knows what she's saying
very well.</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> Niece, I have been a villain to this lady,
I confess. But, my dear Amelia, Providence has
done you justice in part. From the first month I
quitted you, I have never entered one happy hour on
my journal; hearing that you foundered, and considering
myself the cause, the worm of remorse has
gnawed my timbers.</p>

<p><i>Amelia.</i> You're not still offended with me?</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> Me! can you forgive my offence, and condescend
to take my hand as an atonement?</p>

<p><i>Amelia.</i> Your hand! Do you forget that we are
already married?</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> Ay, there was my rascality.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> You may say that.</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> Hold your tongue, you impudent crimp,
you pander, you bad adviser&mdash;I'll strike my false
colours&mdash;I'll now acknowledge the chaplain you provided
was&mdash;</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Was a good man, and a greater honour to
his black, than your honour has been to your blue

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> Your brother!</p>

<p><i>Banks.</i> Captain Seymour! have I found you, sir?</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> My dear Banks, I'll make every reparation.&mdash;Amelia
shall really be my wife.</p>

<p><i>Banks.</i> That, sir, my sister is already; for when I
performed the marriage ceremony, which you took
only as the cloak of your deception, I was actually
in orders.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> Now, who's the crimp, and the pander? I
never told you this since; because I thought a man's
own reflections were the best punishment for betraying
an innocent woman.</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> Madam, my inmost soul partaketh of
thy gladness, and joy for thy reformation. [<i>To</i> <span class="smallcaps">Sir
George</span>.] But thy prior marriage to this lady, annuls
the subsequent, and my cousin Harry is not now thy
heir.</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> So much the better; he's an unnatural
cub; but, Amelia, I flatter myself I have an heir, my
infant boy.&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Amelia.</i> Ah, husband, you had; but&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> Gone! well, well, I see I have been a
miserable scoundrel&mdash;Eh, I will, yes, I'll adopt that
brave kind lad, that wou'dn't let any body kill me
but himself. He shall have my estate, that's my own
acquisition&mdash;My lady, marry him, puppy unknown's
a fine fellow! Amelia, only for him, you'd never have
found your husband Captain Seymour in Sir George
Thunder.</p>

<p><i>Land.</i> Please you, madam, they've got a footpad in

<p><i>Eph.</i> I am come to sit in judgment, for there is
a bad man in thy house, Mary. Bring him before
me.</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> Before you, old squintabus? And perhaps
you don't know I'm a magistrate?</p>

<p><i>Eph.</i> I'll examine him.</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> You be damn'd&mdash;I'll examine him myself,
[<i>Shoves</i> <span class="smallcaps">Ephraim</span>.] Tow him in here. I'll give him
a passport to Winchester bilboes.</p>

<p><i>Amelia.</i> [<i>Kneels to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Sir George</span>.] Oh, sir, as you
hope for mercy, extend it to this youth; but even
should he be guilty, which, from our knowledge of his
benevolent and noble nature, I think next to an impossibility,
let the services he has rendered to us&mdash;he
protected, relieved your forsaken wife, and her unhappy
brother, in the hour of want and sorrow.</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> What, Amelia, plead for a robber! Consider,
my love, justice is above bias or partiality. If
my son violated the laws of his country, I'd deliver
him up a public victim to disgrace and punishment.</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> Oh, my impartial uncle! Had thy country
any laws to punish him, who instead of paltry
gold, would rob the artless virgin of her dearest treasure,
in the rigid judge I should now behold the
trembling criminal.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> My dear fellow, are you safe.</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> Yes, Dick, I was brought in here very safe,
I assure you.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> A confederate in custody below has made a
confession of their villainy, that they concerted this
plan to accuse him of a robbery; first for revenge,
then, in hope to share the reward for apprehending
him: he also owns they are not sailors, but depredators
on the public.</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> Keep them safe in limbo. [<i>Ruffians taken
off.</i>]&mdash;Not knowing that the justice of peace, whom
they've brought the lad now here before, is the very
man they attacked, ha, ha, ha! The rogues have fallen
into their own snare.</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> What, now, you're a justice of peace; well
said, Abrawang!</p>

<p><i>Amelia.</i> Then, Sir George, you know him too?</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> Know puppy unknown! to be sure.</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> Madam, I am happy to see you again. [<i>To</i>
<span class="smallcaps">Amelia</span>.]&mdash;Ah, how do you do, my kind host?</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Shakes hands with</i> <span class="smallcaps">Banks</span>.</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> I rejoice at thy safety&mdash;Be reconciled to
him. [<i>To</i> <span class="smallcaps">Sir George</span>.]</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> Reconciled!&mdash;If I don't love, respect, and
honour him, I should be unworthy of the life he
rescued. But who is he?</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Sir, he is&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> Dick, I thank you for your good wishes; but
I am still determined not to impose on this lady&mdash;Madam,
as I at first told this well meaning tar, when
he forced me to your house, I am not the son of Sir
George Thunder.</p>

<p><i>John.</i> No! Then I wish you were the son of an
admiral, and I your father.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> You refuse the lady? To punish you, I've
a mind to take her myself.&mdash;My dear cousin&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> Stop, Dick.&mdash;If I, who adore her, won't,
you shall not. No, no; madam, never mind what
this fellow says, he's as poor as myself&mdash;Isn't he,
Abrawang.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Then, my dear Rover, since you are so obstinately
disinterested, I'll no longer teize my father,
whom you here see, and in your strolling friend, his
very truant Harry, that ran from Portsmouth school,
and joined you and fellow comedians.</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> Indeed!</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Dear cousin, forgive me, if, through my
zeal for the happiness of my friend, I endeavoured to
promote yours, by giving you a husband more worthy
than myself. [<i>To</i> <span class="smallcaps">Lady Amaranth</span>.]</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> Am I to believe! Madam, is your uncle,
Sir George Thunder, in this room?</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> He is.&mdash;[<i>Looking at</i> <span class="smallcaps">Sir George</span>.]</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> 'Tis so! You, in reality, what I've had the
impudence to assume! and have perplexed your father
with my ridiculous effrontery.&mdash;[<i>Turns to</i> <span class="smallcaps">John
Dory</span>, <i>angry</i>.] I told you, I insisted I wasn't the person
you took me for, but you must bring your damned
chariot! I am ashamed and mortified. Madam, I
beg to take my leave.</p>

<p><i>Eph.</i> Thou art welcome to go.</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> [<i>Bows.</i>] Sir George, as the father of my
friend, I cannot lift my hand against you; but I hope,
sir, you'll apologize to me. <span class="ex">[<i>Apart.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> Ay, with pleasure, my noble splinter&mdash;now
tell me from what dock you were launched, my
heart of oak?</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> I've heard, in England, sir; but from my
earliest knowledge, till within a very few years, I've
been in the East Indies.</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> Beyond seas? Well, and how?</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> It seems I was committed an infant to the
care of a lady, who was herself obliged by the <i>gentle</i>
Hyder Ally, to strike her toilet, and decamp without
beat of drum, leaving me a chubby little fellow squatted
on a carpet. A serjeant's wife alone returned, and
snatched me off triumphant, through fire, smoke, cannon,
cries, and carnage.</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> Dost thou mark? [<i>To</i> <span class="smallcaps">Amelia</span>.]</p>

<p><i>Amelia.</i> Sir, can you recollect the name of the
town, where&mdash;</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> Yes, ma'am, the town was Negapatnam.</p>

<p><i>Amelia.</i> I thank you, sir.</p>
<p class="right">[<i>Gazes with delight and earnestness on</i> <span class="smallcaps">Rover</span>.</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> An officer, who'd much rather act Hotspur
on the stage, than in the field, brought me up behind
the scenes at the Calcutta theatre&mdash;I was rolled
on the boards, acted myself into the favour of a colonel,&mdash;promised
a pair of colours; but, impatient to find my
parents, hid myself in the steerage of an homeward
bound ship; assumed the name of Rover, from the uncertainty
of my fate, and, having murdered more
poets than Rajahs, stept on English ground, unincumbered
with rupees or pagodas. Ha, ha! Wou'dst thou
come home so, little Ephraim?</p>

<p><i>Eph.</i> I would bring myself home with some money.</p>

<p><i>Amelia.</i> Excuse my curiosity, sir; what was the
lady's name in whose care you were left?</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> Oh, ma'am, she was the lady of a Major
Linstock: but I heard my mother's name was Seymour.</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> Why, Amelia!</p>

<p><i>Amelia.</i> My son!</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> Madam!</p>

<p><i>Amelia.</i> It is my Charles! <span class="ex">[<i>Embraces&nbsp;him.</i></span></p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> Eh!</p>

<p><i>John.</i> [<i>Sings and capers, claps</i> <span class="smallcaps">Ephraim</span> <i>on the
shoulders</i>.] Tol, lol, lol, though I never heard it before,
my heart told me he was a chip of the old
block.</p>

<p><i>Amelia.</i> Your father!&mdash;</p>
<p class="right">[<i>To</i> <span class="smallcaps">Rover</span>, <i>pointing to</i> <span class="smallcaps">Sir George</span>.</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> Can it?&mdash;Heaven! then have I attempted
to raise my impious hand against a parent's life!</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> My dear brave boy! Then have I a son
with spirit to fight me as a stranger, yet defend me as
a father.</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> [<i>Takes him by the hand.</i>] Uncle, you'll
recollect 'twas I, who first introduced a son to thee.</p>

<p><i>Sir Geo.</i> And I hope you will next introduce a
grandson to me, young slyboots. Harry, you've lost
your fortune.</p>

<p><i>Harry.</i> Yes, sir, but I've gained a brother, whose
friendship (before I knew him to be such,) I prized
above the first fortune in England.</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> My generous friend&mdash;My dearest Rosalind!</p>

<p><i>Amelia.</i> Then, will you take our Charles? [<i>To</i> <span class="smallcaps">L. Amaranth</span>.]</p>

<p><i>Lady Am.</i> Yea; but only on condition thou bestowest
thy fortune on his friend and brother, mine
is sufficient for us, is it not?</p>

<p><i>Rover.</i> Angelic creature!&mdash;to think of my generous
friend&mdash;But now for "As you like it." Where's
Lamp and Trap&mdash;I shall ever love a play&mdash;a spark
from Shakspeare's Muse of Fire, was the star that
guided me through my desolate and bewildered maze
of life, and brought me to these unexpected blessings.</p>

Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions
will be renamed.

Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no
one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation
(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without
permission and without paying copyright royalties.  Special rules,
set forth in the General Terms of Use part of this license, apply to
copying and distributing Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works to
protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm concept and trademark.  Project
Gutenberg is a registered trademark, and may not be used if you
charge for the eBooks, unless you receive specific permission.  If you
do not charge anything for copies of this eBook, complying with the
rules is very easy.  You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose
such as creation of derivative works, reports, performances and
research.  They may be modified and printed and given away--you may do
practically ANYTHING with public domain eBooks.  Redistribution is
subject to the trademark license, especially commercial
redistribution.

(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase "Project
Gutenberg"), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full Project
Gutenberg-tm License (available with this file or online at

Section 1.  General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works

1.A.  By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement.  If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or destroy
all copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in your possession.
If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work and you do not agree to be bound by the
terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person or
entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.

1.B.  "Project Gutenberg" is a registered trademark.  It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement.  There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement.  See
paragraph 1.C below.  There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this agreement
and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.  See paragraph 1.E below.

1.C.  The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation ("the Foundation"
or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection of Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works.  Nearly all the individual works in the
collection are in the public domain in the United States.  If an
individual work is in the public domain in the United States and you are
located in the United States, we do not claim a right to prevent you from
copying, distributing, performing, displaying or creating derivative
works based on the work as long as all references to Project Gutenberg
are removed.  Of course, we hope that you will support the Project
Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting free access to electronic works by
freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm works in compliance with the terms of
this agreement for keeping the Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with
the work.  You can easily comply with the terms of this agreement by
keeping this work in the same format with its attached full Project
Gutenberg-tm License when you share it without charge with others.

1.D.  The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work.  Copyright laws in most countries are in
a constant state of change.  If you are outside the United States, check
the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this agreement
before downloading, copying, displaying, performing, distributing or
creating derivative works based on this work or any other Project
Gutenberg-tm work.  The Foundation makes no representations concerning
the copyright status of any work in any country outside the United
States.

1.E.  Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:

1.E.1.  The following sentence, with active links to, or other immediate
access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear prominently
whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work on which the

Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed, performed, viewed,
copied or distributed:

from the public domain (does not contain a notice indicating that it is
posted with permission of the copyright holder), the work can be copied
and distributed to anyone in the United States without paying any fees
or charges.  If you are redistributing or providing access to a work
with the phrase "Project Gutenberg" associated with or appearing on the
work, you must comply either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1
through 1.E.7 or obtain permission for the use of the work and the
Project Gutenberg-tm trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or
1.E.9.

1.E.3.  If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any additional
terms imposed by the copyright holder.  Additional terms will be linked
to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works posted with the
permission of the copyright holder found at the beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this

Gutenberg-tm License.

     address specified in Section 4, "Information about donations to
     the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation."

     you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
     does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
     License.  You must require such a user to return or

     and discontinue all use of and all access to other copies of
     Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS' WITH NO OTHER
WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO
WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTIBILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5.  Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of damages.
If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement violates the
law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be
interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or limitation permitted by
the applicable state law.  The invalidity or unenforceability of any
provision of this agreement shall not void the remaining provisions.

1.F.6.  INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in accordance
with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the production,
promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works,
harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
